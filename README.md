# Submit CRAB jobs using CATTools
## 1. This is based on crab3
 - no need to change configurations since jobs are stored all in remote servers
 - make sure crab3 is setup first
```bash
source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/crab3/crab.sh
```

## 2. Using submitCrab3.py
- This script can be used to pass CRAB configuration parameters from the command line depending on the Dataset lists are located on MC/ or RD/ directories for data type.

### 2-1. Usage 
```bash
./submitCrab3.py [Dataset1.txt] [Dataset2.txt]
```

### 2-2. Example
- If we want to submit cattuple ttbar and diboson datasets.
```bash
cd $SRT_CMSSW_BASE_SCRAMRTDEL/src/CATTools/CatProducer/prod/crab
./submitCrab3.py MC/ttbar_dilepton.txt MC/diboson.txt
```

### 2-3.Submitting jobs
- because the jobs only saved in local storage (where the job was done) we need to get the output manually. 
- this has the benefit of crab jobs not failing due to transfer errors
- to get the output use "crab out -t <taskdir>" or the script below
```bash
python getcrabOut.py
```
